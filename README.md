# KSK plugging system
In wiring system they used some connectors to join electrical terminations.. these connectors have some holes or cavities which can be wired or not.
The state of cavities depends on the client request so that’s not constant. If a cavity is not needed they put a plug in it.

The usual word process: They put wires based on some data. The rest of cavities they don’t need them. Then another operator fill the rest of cavities with plugs.
The problem here is putting wires before plugs makes the process more slow and need more work than the opposite, so they ask us to build an application that analyze client data and based on that data this application will generate image of connectors needed with the plugs on them.
So the process will start from the opposite, they will put plugs before wires
